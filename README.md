## Acknowledgements
I'd like to extend my sincerest gratitude to Sara Echeverria for the initial inspiration and code foundation of this portfolio.
Her work significantly influenced the early stages of this project.
However, it's important to note that I have made extensive modifications and customizations to tailor the project to my personal style and requirements.
Sara's contribution was instrumental in shaping the initial structure and design, which I have since evolved and built upon to reflect my personal journey and skills.
